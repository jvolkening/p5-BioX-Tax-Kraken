**WARNING**: Currently in pre-alpha phase. Do not use!

`BioX::Tax::Kraken` is a simple interface to a Kraken-style flatfile
taxonomic database, typically using the filename 'taxDB'. This file format is
a four-column tab-delimited text file, where the columns contain:

1. taxonomic ID

2. parent ID

3. name (typically scientific)

4. rank

This distribution has a single class with methods to look up and compare
entries in a Kraken-style taxonomic database based on one or more taxonomic
IDs. It is designed to be simple and correct, and it is written to balance
speed and memory consumption. It is neither blazing fast nor ultra memory
efficient; there are better options for taxonomic data storage formats and
interfaces if you have one of these requirements. This software's only purpose
is to facilitate easy access to the information stored in a Kraken-style
database if you are already using that format for other reasons.
